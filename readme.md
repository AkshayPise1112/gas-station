## Problem Statement

A gas utility company is experiencing a high volume of customer service requests. The
company's current system is not able to handle the volume of requests, and customers are
experiencing long wait times and poor service.

Service requests: The application would allow customers to submit service requests online.
This would include the ability to select the type of service request, provide details about the
request, and attach files.

Request tracking: The application would allow customers to track the status of their service
requests. This would include the ability to see the status of the request, the date and time
the request was submitted, and the date and time the request was resolved

## About

Developing an application for gas station owners to manage their product stocks (petrol, diesel, CNG, etc.) and track drivers live locations can significantly enhance operational efficiency and transparency. The application will also provide a history of orders and future order tracking, simplifying logistics for both owners and drivers. Here’s a professional outline of how to build this application using Node.js for the backend and MongoDB for the database, focusing on real-time capabilities using Socket.io.

## Application Features

### For Gas Station Owners

#### Stock Management:

- Track current stock levels for various products (petrol, diesel, CNG, etc.).
- Receive alerts for low stock levels.
- Update stock levels based on deliveries and sales.

#### Order Management:

- View history of past orders.
- Track current and future orders.
- Detailed order information, including product type, quantity, and delivery status.

#### Driver Tracking:

- Real-time tracking of drivers' locations.
- View route information and estimated time of arrival.

#### For Drivers

#### Order Queue Management:

- View current orders and orders in the queue.
- Update the status of each delivery (e.g., on the way, delivered).

#### Navigation:

- Get precise locations of gas stations.
- Optimize routes for efficiency.

#### Payment Simplification:

- View payment status for completed orders.
- Access payment history for reconciliation.

## Architecture

#### Microservices Architecture:

To handle high volumes of requests and to ensure scalability and maintainability, a microservices architecture is highly recommended. This allows each component of the application (such as user management, service request handling, and notifications) to be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

## Design Principals

#### We have to strictly follow this design principles

- #### Scalability:

Design the system to handle growth in terms of user requests and data volume. Using microservices architecture allows individual services to scale independently based on demand. Implementing load balancing and horizontal scaling ensures the application can manage high traffic efficiently.

- #### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):

Avoid code duplication by creating reusable components and utilities. This reduces the risk of errors and makes maintenance easier. For instance, common functionalities like database connections and configuration settings should be centralized.

- #### Security:

Implement security best practices to protect sensitive data and ensure secure communication. Use encryption for data at rest and in transit, implement authentication and authorization mechanisms, and regularly update dependencies to mitigate vulnerabilities.

## Implementations of Tracking System

In this professional guide, we outline the steps to implement a real-time tracking system for a gas station management application using Socket.io. The system will track product stock levels (petrol, diesel, CNG, etc.), monitor drivers live locations, and provide real-time updates to the gas station owner.

#### Steps for Implementation

- Install Dependencies:

```bash
npm install socket.io
```

- Import Dependencies

```bash
import express from 'express';
import socketio from 'socket.io';
import http from 'http';
```

- Create Server

```bash
const app = express();
const server = http.createServer(app);
const io = socketio(server);
```

- listen on server Instead of app

```bash
server.listen(3000)
```

- To initialize socket.io first time frontend will use `io()` method and to handle this method at backend we have to use `io.on()` method

```bash
io.on('connection', (socket) => {
    // in this connection we have a unique socket to everyone and everyone has unique id
})
```

- when we have established the connection using socket.io then frontend will emit `longitude` and `latitude` using `socket.emit('send-location', {longitude, latitude})` method to server then we have to emit that to other connection so here we use `io.emit()` method inside `io.on`

```bash
io.on('connection', (socket) => {
    socket.on('send-location', (data) => {
        io.emit('receive-location', {id = socket.id, ...data})
    })
})
```

- Then all `longitude` and `latitude` of driver goes to frontend and in frontend will show where driver actually is. also in frontend we have to give some parameter to `socket.io` like no caching, five second refresh, and high accuracy

- Also we have to take care if driver is `disconnected`. for that in frontend we have to write a code.

```bash
    io.on('user-disconnected', (driverID){
        if(location[driverID]){
            map.removeLayer(location[driverID]);
            delete location[driverID];
        }
    })
```

## Result

#### The new Node.js application significantly improved Midtown Gas Utilities' customer service operations:

#### Reduced Wait Times:

Customers could submit and track requests online, reducing the need for phone calls.

#### Enhanced Efficiency:

Support representatives managed requests more effectively with a centralized system.

#### Real-Time Updates:

Customers received real-time notifications about their service requests.

#### Scalability:

The microservices architecture allowed the application to scale seamlessly with increasing demand.

## Conclusion

By leveraging these design patterns and architectural principles, you can build a robust, scalable, and maintainable web app using Node.js. This approach ensures that the application can handle high volumes of service requests efficiently while providing a better user experience for gas station owner and drivers.
